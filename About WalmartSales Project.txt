## About

This is a collaborative project with Prince Kramph: https://www.linkedin.com/in/prince-krampah-5a2b921bb/

In this project we delved into data exploration to extract insights to help the management to revamp their existing strategies for optimal gains.


## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). 

This dataset contains sales transactions from a three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. 

The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows:

### Analysis List

1. Product Analysis

> Conduct analysis on the data to understand the different product lines, the products lines performing best and the product lines that need to be improved.

2. Sales Analysis

> This analysis aims to answer the question of the sales trends of product. 
The result of this can help us measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy the business applies and what modificatoins are needed to gain more sales.

3. Customer Analysis

> This analysis aims to uncover the different customers segments, purchase trends and the profitability of each customer segment.

## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling:** 

This is where the dataset provided is inspected and adjusted accordingly - Inspection of **NULL** values, missing values, e.t.c

> 1. Build a database
> 2. Create table and insert the data.


2. **Data restructuring / Data Engineering:** 

This is needed to add some new columns as required in our analysis. 

> 1. Add a new column named `time_of_day` to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales occur.

> 2. Add a new column named `day_name` that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.

> 3. Add a new column named `month_name` that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). This will help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of this project.

## Revenue And Profit Calculations

$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

$VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

**Gross Margin** is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

<u>**Example with the first row in our DB:**</u>

**Data given:**

- $ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
- $ \text{Quantity} = 7 $

$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5\% * COGS\\= 5\%  320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = $336.5565$

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\\approx 4.7619\% $
