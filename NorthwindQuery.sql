--we would need to know the staff name, the total amount of money the staff has handled during 
--a customer transaction and the department this staff belongs to. (Remember, we want just the sales Rep staff).

---Please, help the Finance department to generate a summary table that shows the full name 
--(last + first name combined), the total amount of transaction, and the title of these employees.

--Put this output in a view.

LEFT JOIN Orders AS o
USING (EmployeeID)
LEFT JOIN Order_Details AS ord
USING (OrderID)
WHERE title = 'Sales Representative'
GROUP BY EmployeeID
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Task 2---

--The board of directors are interested in seeing the volume of transactions this business has made. 
--your mission: In the operation year, give a breakdown of the total number of orders by year and by month.

SELECT COUNT(orderid) AS Total_Order, 
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM orderdate) AS Year, 
TO_CHAR(orderdate, 'Month') AS Month,

ORDER BY 2,4 ASC;

--TOTAL TRANSACTION BY YEAR

SELECT COUNT(orderid) AS Total_Order, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM orderdate) AS "Year of transaction"

TO_CHAR(orderdate,'Month') AS "Months of Transaction",
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM orderdate) AS "Month_no"

--The directors are planning to expand their customer base in some countries. 
--Generate a ranked table from the customers table that displays the 
--customer id, company name, city, country, total quantity, and the ranked value.
--This rank table should be partitioned by country.

SELECT c.CustomerID, CompanyName, City, Country, COUNT(orderid) AS Total_Qty,
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY Country ORDER BY quantity) AS Rank_No
