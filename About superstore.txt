This project is about a superstore, that is ranked as one of the world’s largest suppliers of Bikes, clothing and accessories with over 2,000 retail stores across different countries worldwide. 

despite the brand’s global presence and success, the company was faced with low patronage and revenues.

As a data-analyst, I was contracted to join the Welup Digital Team as an Intern to carry out a thorough analysis of the dataset provided and come-up with insights on how to improve patronage, sales, and profit.


A total of nine different datasets were provided as listed below:
customer.csv, product-categories.csv, products.csv, product-subcategories.csv, returns.csv, territories.csv, sales-2015.csv, sales-2016.csv, sales-2017.csv.

The metrics for the analysis are detailed below:

1. Total Revenue actualized during the period.
2. Total Profit actualized during the period.
3. Total Return.
4. Total quantities sold.
5. What occupation of customers patronized Robbin’s company the most?
6. Revenue by Customer Gender
7. Revenue by Product category.
8. Revenue by Region
9. Sales trend
